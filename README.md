👋 Hi, I’m Justin Clyde Frongoso, a fourth-year BS Computer Science undergraduate of University of the Philippines - Diliman.

👀 You can call me Prongs and I write code from time to time.

🏆 I'm a dedicated competitor and had several wins on local competitions during my three years in the university.

📫 I have experience on PERN stack, React, and a combination of Sveltekit and Firebase on some of my dev projects.

📫 I am into AI and ML lately, gradually adding it on some Flask apps. I'm also doing reinforcement learning research using computer vision.

📞 If you are interested, you can approach me by emailing me through my personal email (clydefrongoso@gmail.com).
